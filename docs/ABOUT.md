🔙 [@evnt Project](../README.md)

## Prior Art

Back when I started going to cosplay conventions, in Turkey specifically, I had issues finding events and gathering information (date, time, place, price) about them. I created an instagram profile for announcing any events I came accross so others could find them too. After a while, I realized one crucial issue: properties of events are volatile, and can change; instagram posts cannot.

To solve this issue, I started developing a [website](https://events.deniz.blue) for keeping a list of these events where users could follow events and recieve push notifications whenever something changes. At first I entered all the data manually, but the main idea was that event organizers would authenticate and update event data themselves. After a while, I noticed the need for i18n and implemented it, along with some other niche features. Developing the website sure took a while but it gave me valuable insight for the current event data format we are defining right here.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to create a **standardized**, **open format** for representing event data that can be used across different applications and platforms. This format should be flexible enough to accommodate various types of events, from small meetups to large conferences.
